`sbt-release-early` is an sbt plugin to follow the maxim
`"Release early, release often"`. It provides an automatic way to release
artifacts on merge and via git tags, as well as some nice features to make
the release process less cumbersome.

Goals:
1. Maintainers cut and handle releases in a breeze.
1. Users do not need to beg maintainers to release.
1. Open-source contributors have access to their changes as soon as their PRs are merged.

## Installation

Add the latest version of this library to your project with the following sbt line:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "ch.epfl.scala" % "sbt-release-early" % "0.1.0"
```

#### Add Scala Center's bintray resolver

Our Bintray resolver is useful to depend on non-final releases or final releases of
`sbt-release-early` that are on their way to Maven Central. To add this resolver to
your build, drop the following line in your build:

```scala
resolvers in Global += Resolver.bintrayRepo("scalacenter", "sbt-maven-releases")
```

## Requirements

If you want to use `sbt-release-early`, you need to:
  
* Use git and have it in the `PATH` (required by sbt-dynver).
* Have a [Bintray](bintray) account.

To synchronize your artifacts with Maven Central, you need to:
* Have a [Sonatype](sonatype) account.
* Have a GPG key that **is published to [pgp.mit.edu](http://pgp.mit.edu/)**.
* [Set up Bintray for it](#synchronization-with-maven-central).

## How to use it

1. Make sure you fulfill all the [requirements](#requirements).
1. Make sure your build and CI are [correctly set up](#configure-your-release).
1. Run `sbt releaseEarly` in your CI.

## Dependencies

This plugin relies on the following sbt plugins:

* [`sbt-dynver`](sbtdynver), version `1.3.0`.
* [`sbt-pgp`](sbtpgp), version `1.0.0`.
* [`sbt-bintray`](sbtbintray), version `0.5.0`.

If you already depend on them, remove them from your `plugins.sbt` file.

## The plugin in a nutshell

Every time you *push a commit* to a branch, `sbt-release-early` will release an
artifact with a version derived from the git metadata (version and distance from
last git tag). For example, `0.3.0+10-4f489199`, where `10` is the distance
and the suffix is the commit hash.

Every time you *push a tag* to a branch, `sbt-release-early` will release an
artifact with that tag version. This feature is usually used to cut final releases,
for example, `v0.1.0`.

### Why this way

`sbt-release-early` takes a distinct approach to releases.

While some projects decide to declare versions in sbt files, `sbt-release-early`
derives the versions of your project from your git tags. This has several benefits:

1. Reproducibility.
2. Tag uniqueness. Git prevents you from trying to release a version twice by mistake.*
3. No need to push commits to bump up the versions of your projects.
4. The tag history shows all the released versions over the time of a project.

These properties reduce the complexity of handling releases significantly.
The repository revision history becomes the ultimate truth and build-related
tasks are easy to set up -- no need to resolve the latest version or scrap
the library version from its sbt build.

\* This assumes you won't ever delete a an already pushed tag. Don't make life more
dangerous that what it already is.

### Version schema

The version lingo is extracted from the [Semantic Versioning document](semver).

This documentation and this plugin assumes that:
* Version numbers are **final** if they **only** consist of a MAJOR, MINOR and PATCH VERSION.
  For example, `1.0.1`, `2.4.98` and `10.1.6` are final releases.
* Any other version number that contains build metadata or qualifiers like `RC`,
  `beta` or `alpha` are considered SNAPSHOTs even if they lack the `-SNAPSHOT`
  suffix. For example, `0.3.0+10-4f489199`, `8.9.1-1f43aa21` or `1.0.0-RC` are snapshots.

Note that the snapshot does not have a precise and commonly accepted definition.
`sbt-release-early`s definition differs from the common understanding of snapshot
versions in the Scala community.

`sbt-release-early` considers the most literal definition of snapshot: it's a release
that mirrors the codebase at a given point of time and whose artifacts could not provide
the same guarantees as final releases. These guarantees are established by library authors.

#### Why not regular `-SNAPSHOT`s?

Snapshots have important shortcomings:

1. They are **not reproducible**: downstream users can get different snapshot releases
depending on the time they resolve/update them.
2. Their **resolution times are slower**: build tools have to check all artifacts in all resolvers to choose
the appropriate version.

The use of snapshots is no longer justified with `sbt-release-early` and sbt plugins like
[sbt-dynver](sbtdynver) that derive automatic versions from git invariants.
`sbt-release-early` keeps your builds **faster and more reproducible**.

## Configure your release

### Configure your CI and your build

Whether you use Drone or not, the following [.drone.yml](.drone.yml) can inspire you.

Your **CI** needs to provide:
1. The bintray username and password. Preferred choice is via the `BINTRAY_USERNAME`
and `BINTRAY_PASSWORD` environment variables. More in the [official docs](bintray-publishing).
2. The sonatype username and password. Either via:
    1. `SONATYPE_USER` and `SONATYPE_PASSWORD`; or
    1. `SONA_USER` or `SONA_PASS`.
3. The pgp password through an environment variable.
    
Your **build** needs to provide the following settings for every publishable module
(with `.settings(publishSettings)`) or globally (appending `in Global` to every key).
```scala
lazy val publishSettings = Seq(
  // The sbt-pgp requirements for tag-driven releases and Maven Central sync
  pgpPassphrase := sys.env.get("PGP_PASSWORD").map(_.toArray),
  pgpPublicRing := file("LOCATION_OF_YOUR_CI_PUBLIC_RING"),
  pgpSecretRing := file("LOCATION_OF_YOUR_CI_SECRET_RING"),
  // These are the **minimum** requirements to release with `sbt-release-early`
  publishMavenStyle := true,
  bintrayRepository := "your-bintray-maven-repository",
  licenses := Seq(
    // Your license, I recommend the Mozilla Public License!
    "MPL-2.0" -> url("https://opensource.org/licenses/MPL-2.0")
  ),
  homepage := Some(url("https://github.com/your-handle/your-project")),
  scmInfo := Some(ScmInfo(
      url("https://github.com/your-handle/your-project"),
      "scm:git:git@github.com:your-handle/your-project.git"
  )),
  developers := List(
    Developer("your-handle", "Your Name", "email@somewhere.me", url("https://github.com/your-handle"))
  ),
  // Nice to have: don't publish tests sources
  publishArtifact in Test := false
)
```

If you want to further customize bintray's or pgp's settings, read the docs of the dependent plugins
in [requirements](#requirements).

Once you have made sure the CI and the build are correctly set up, you only need to do
`sbt releaseEarly` **in the CI**. Note that this will fail if you do it locally.

If you want to try your setup with a random version locally, you can
define `releaseEarlyEnableLocalReleases := true` in your projects so that local releases are enabled.
This is **not recommended**.

### Secure releases


No matter what your CI is, you need to ensure that:
* You only depend on trusted sbt plugins (with final releases, i.e. no SNAPSHOTs).
* Releases only happen in branches that are write-protected and to which only the maintainers have access.
* Releases are disabled for pull requests. This prevents malicious users from adding sbt plugins or introspecting the build.
* Your CI configuration files are signed so that no one can have access to the environment variables.
* Your publish step does as less work as possible (for example, no test execution).

For instance, Drone provides an automatic way to:
* Scope environment variables to concrete pipeline steps.
* Execute pipeline steps only for concrete events or branches.
* Sign the configuration files (.drone.yml).

If your CI does not ensure any of these points, you are encouraged to give
Drone a try. It's one of the best CIs out there.

### Synchronization with Maven Central

This feature is optional, but **enabled by default for releases via tag**.
To disable it, scope the following key in your project or globally:
```scala
releaseEarlyEnableSyncToMaven := false
```

#### What do I need to synchronize with Maven Central?

1. You need to create a **Maven** Bintray repository. <p>
![bintray_maven](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2462974/27399758-21607d3a-56be-11e7-919d-06b9315e22ee.png)
1. When you've done your first non-final release, you need to synchronize
your Bintray package with **JCenter**. <p>
![jcenter-to-link](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2462974/27399894-9527a72a-56be-11e7-944f-f27e73d5c09f.png)

The Bintray team will accept your package into the JCenter repository.
This process will last one or two hours and when they accept your package you will receive
a notification and see the following section in your bintray package interface.

![jcenter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2462974/27399886-89e42258-56be-11e7-8608-796a71b1db0d.png)

Then, if you provide all the required [credentials](#configure-your-ci-and-your-build),
`releaseEarly` will will sync your artifacts with Maven Central for free.
