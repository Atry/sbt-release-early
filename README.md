## Meet `sbt-release-early`

`sbt-release-early` is an sbt plugin to follow the maxim
*"Release early, release often"*. It provides an automatic way to release
artifacts on merge and via git tags, and automates all the necessary steps to
make releasing easy.

Goals:
1. Maintainers cut and handle releases in a breeze.
1. Users do not need to beg maintainers to release.
1. Open-source contributors have access to their changes as soon as their PRs are merged.

## Read the docs

The docs are placed in a [detailed GitHub wiki](https://github.com/scalacenter/sbt-release-early/wiki).

It explains how to:
* Install and use the plugin.
* Set up your CI and infrastructure.
* Release with ease for different backends and CIs.

## Configure your release

### Configure your CI and your build

Whether you use Drone or not, the following [.drone.yml](.drone.yml) can inspire you.

Your **CI** needs to provide:
1. The bintray username and password. Preferred choice is via the `BINTRAY_USERNAME`
and `BINTRAY_PASSWORD` environment variables. More in the [official docs](bintray-publishing).
2. The sonatype username and password. Either via:
    1. `SONATYPE_USER` and `SONATYPE_PASSWORD`; or
    1. `SONA_USER` or `SONA_PASS`.
3. The pgp password through an environment variable.
    
Your **build** needs to provide the following settings for every publishable module
(with `.settings(publishSettings)`) or globally (appending `in Global` to every key).
```scala
lazy val publishSettings = Seq(
  // The sbt-pgp requirements for tag-driven releases and Maven Central sync
  pgpPassphrase := sys.env.get("PGP_PASSWORD").map(_.toArray),
  pgpPublicRing := file("LOCATION_OF_YOUR_CI_PUBLIC_RING"),
  pgpSecretRing := file("LOCATION_OF_YOUR_CI_SECRET_RING"),
  // These are the **minimum** requirements to release with `sbt-release-early`
  publishMavenStyle := true,
  bintrayRepository := "your-bintray-maven-repository",
  licenses := Seq(
    // Your license, I recommend the Mozilla Public License!
    "MPL-2.0" -> url("https://opensource.org/licenses/MPL-2.0")
  ),
  homepage := Some(url("https://github.com/your-handle/your-project")),
  scmInfo := Some(ScmInfo(
      url("https://github.com/your-handle/your-project"),
      "scm:git:git@github.com:your-handle/your-project.git"
  )),
  developers := List(
    Developer("your-handle", "Your Name", "email@somewhere.me", url("https://github.com/your-handle"))
  ),
  // Nice to have: don't publish tests sources
  publishArtifact in Test := false
)
```

If you want to further customize bintray's or pgp's settings, read the docs of the dependent plugins
in [requirements](#requirements).

Once you have made sure the CI and the build are correctly set up, you only need to do
`sbt releaseEarly` **in the CI**. Note that this will fail if you do it locally.

If you want to try your setup with a random version locally, you can
define `releaseEarlyEnableLocalReleases := true` in your projects so that local releases are enabled.
This is **not recommended**.
