`sbt-release-early` is an sbt plugin to follow the maxim
`"Release early, release often"`. It provides a way to release artifacts
on merge in an easy way thanks to its support for automatic releases.
*No user will ever beg you to release an artifact again*!

## Installation

Add the latest version of this library to your project with the following sbt line:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "ch.epfl.scala" % "sbt-release-early" % "0.1.0"
```

#### Non-stable releases

Non-stable releases are freshly released from master on merge using
`sbt-release-early`! To depend on them, add the Scala Center's Bintray resolver
to your sbt project:

```scala
resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("scalacenter", "sbt-maven-releases")
```

## Requirements

If you want to use `sbt-release-early`, you need to:
  
* Use git and have it in the `PATH` (required by sbt-dynver).
* Have a [Bintray](bintray) account.

To synchronize your artifacts with Maven Central, you need to:
* Have a [Sonatype](sonatype) account.
* Have a GPG key that **is published to [pgp.mit.edu](http://pgp.mit.edu/)**.
* [Set up Bintray for it](#synchronization-with-maven-central).

## How to use it

1. Make sure you fulfill all the [requirements](#requirements).
1. Make sure your build and CI are [correctly set up](#configure-your-release).
1. Run `releaseEarly` in your CI.

## Dependencies

This plugin relies on the following sbt plugins:

* [`sbt-dynver`](sbtdynver), version `0.2.0`.
* [`sbt-pgp`](sbtpgp), version `1.0.0`.
* [`sbt-bintray`](sbtbintray), version `0.3.0`.

If you already depend on them, remove them from your `plugins.sbt` file.

## The plugin in a nutshell

Every time you *push a commit* to a branch, `sbt-release-early` will release an
artifact with a version derived from the git metadata (version and distance from
last git tag). For example, `0.3.0+10-4f489199`, where `10` is the distance
and the suffix is the commit hash.

Every time you *push a tag* to a branch, `sbt-release-early` will release an
artifact with that tag version. This feature is usually used to cut final releases,
for example, `v0.1.0`.

### Why this way

`sbt-release-early` takes a distinct approach to releases.

While some projects decide to declare versions in sbt files, `sbt-release-early`
derives the versions of your project from your git tags. This has several benefits:

1. Reproducibility.
2. Tag uniqueness. Git prevents you from trying to release a version twice by mistake.
3. No need to push commits to bump up the versions of your projects.
4. The tag history shows all the released versions over the time of a project.

These properties reduce the complexity of handling releases significantly.
The repository revision history becomes the ultimate truth and build-related
tasks are easy to set up -- no need to resolve the latest version or scrap
the library version from its sbt build.

### Version schema

Any version that is not final is considered a snapshot even if it has a stable
number and lacks the `-SNAPSHOT` suffix. For example, `0.3+10-4f489199` is a
snapshot. This plugin takes the most literal definition of snapshot,
where a snapshot release mirrors your codebase at given point in time.

#### Why not SNAPSHOTs?

Snapshots have important shortcomings:

1. They are not reproducible: downstream users can get different snapshot releases
depending on the time they resolve/update them.
2. Resolution times go up significantly.

Their use in the open-source community is not justified when tools like [sbt-dynver](sbtdynver)
solve derive versions for your software based on invariants of your version control system.

By using automatically derived versions, `sbt-release-early` keeps your builds reproducible
and your resolution times fast.

## Configure your release

### Configure your CI and your build

Whether you use Drone or not, the following [.drone.yml](.drone.yml) can inspire you.

Your CI needs to provide:
1. The bintray username and password. Preferred choice is via the `BINTRAY_USERNAME`
and `BINTRAY_PASSWORD` environment variables. More in the [official docs](bintray-publishing).
2. The sonatype username and password. Either via:
    1. `SONATYPE_USER` and `SONATYPE_PASSWORD`; or
    1. `SONA_USER` or `SONA_PASS`.
3. The pgp password through an environment variable.
    
Your build needs to provide:
1. The following settings for every publishable module (or defined `in Global`):
```scala
lazy val publishSettings = Seq(
  // The sbt-pgp requirements for tag-driven releases and Maven Central sync
  pgpPassphrase := sys.env.get("PGP_PASSWORD").map(_.toArray),
  pgpPublicRing := file("LOCATION_OF_YOUR_CI_PUBLIC_RING"),
  pgpSecretRing := file("LOCATION_OF_YOUR_CI_SECRET_RING"),
  // These are the **minimum** requirements to release with `sbt-release-early`
  publishMavenStyle := true,
  bintrayRepository := "your-bintray-maven-repository",
  licenses := Seq(
    // Your license, I recommend the Mozilla Public License!
    "MPL-2.0" -> url("https://opensource.org/licenses/MPL-2.0")
  ),
  homepage := Some(url("https://github.com/your-handle/your-project")),
  autoAPIMappings := true,
  scmInfo := Some(
    ScmInfo(
      url("https://github.com/your-handle/your-project"),
      "scm:git:git@github.com:your-handle/your-project.git"
    )),
  developers := List(
    Developer("your-handle", "Your Name", "email@somewhere.me", url("https://github.com/your-handle"))
  ),
  // Nice to have: don't publish tests sources
  publishArtifact in Test := false
)
```

### Secure releases


No matter what your CI is, you need to ensure that:
* You only depend on trusted sbt plugins (with stable releases, i.e. no SNAPSHOTs).
* Releases only happen in branches that are write-protected and to which only the maintainers have access.
* Releases are disabled for pull requests. This avoids malicious users adding sbt plugins or introspecting the build.
* Your CI configuration files are signed so that no one can have access to the environment variables.
* Your publish step does as less work as possible (for example, no test execution).

For instance, Drone provides an automatic way to:
* Scope environment variables to concrete pipeline steps.
* Execute pipeline steps only for concrete events or branches.
* Sign the configuration files (.drone.yml).

If your CI does not ensure any of these points, you are encouraged to give
Drone a try. It's one of the best CIs out there.

### Synchronization with Maven Central

This feature is optional, but **enabled by default for releases via tag**.
To disable it, scope the following key in your project or globally:
```scala
releaseEarlyEnableSyncToMaven := false
```

#### What do I need to synchronize with Maven Central?

1. You need to create a **Maven** Bintray repository.
![bintray_maven](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2462974/27399758-21607d3a-56be-11e7-919d-06b9315e22ee.png)
1. When you've done your first non-stable release, you need to synchronize
your Bintray package with **JCenter**.
![jcenter-to-link](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2462974/27399894-9527a72a-56be-11e7-944f-f27e73d5c09f.png)

The Bintray team will accept your package into the JCenter repository within 1 or 2 hours.
You will know that you're ready to publish a stable release when you see the following in
your bintray package interface.

![jcenter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2462974/27399886-89e42258-56be-11e7-8608-796a71b1db0d.png)

Then, if you provide all the required [credentials](#configure-your-ci-and-your-build),
`releaseEarly` will will sync your artifacts with Maven Central for free.
